# Header


This time is by my self... what realy i'll do?
    - Create Folder locally that holdes all the repository in it
    - Create a File in it
    - Initialize repository for it using a keyword 'add' or 'git add'
    - Commit or save/update it with message and description for the message
    - Push or uplode it to remote repository.. like GitHub
        - Remote it using the repository link that created in another machine,
          because we first create the folder and come all the process locally within the local machine
        - Then push it to a remote machine repository using a keyword 'git push origin master'

## Another Header for branching stuffs
	- First we locate to a folder that pushed to the remote repository like GitHub..
	- Seconde we create a branch on a master branch to finally in the hope of to mergeit after some changes
